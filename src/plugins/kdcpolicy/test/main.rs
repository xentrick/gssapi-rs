 *
 * The kdcpolicy pluggable interface currently has only one supported major
 * version, which is 1.  Major version 1 has a current minor version number of
 * 1.
 *
 * kdcpolicy plugin modules should define a function named
 * kdcpolicy_<modulename>_initvt, matching the signature:
 *
 *   krb5_error_code
 *   kdcpolicy_modname_initvt(krb5_context context, int maj_ver, int min_ver,
 *                            krb5_plugin_vtable vtable);
 *
 * The initvt function should:
 *
 * - Check that the supplied maj_ver number is supported by the module, or
 *   return KRB5_PLUGIN_VER_NOTSUPP if it is not.
 *
 * - Cast the vtable pointer as appropriate for maj_ver:
 *   maj_ver == 1: Cast to krb5_kdcpolicy_vtable
 *
 * - Initialize the methods of the vtable, stopping as appropriate for the
 *   supplied min_ver.  Optional methods may be left uninitialized.
 *
 * Memory for the vtable is allocated by the caller, not by the module.
