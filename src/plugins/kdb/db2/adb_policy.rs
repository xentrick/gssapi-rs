    /* ** Plugin framework ***/
    /*
 * This framework can be used to create pluggable interfaces.  Not all existing
 * pluggable interface use this framework, but new ones should.  A new
 * pluggable interface entails:
 *
 * - An interface ID definition in the list of #defines below.
 *
 * - A name in the interface_names array in lib/krb5/krb/plugins.c.
 *
 * - An installed public header file in include/krb5.  The public header should
 *   include <krb5/plugin.h> and should declare a vtable structure for each
 *   supported major version of the interface.
 *
 * - A consumer API implementation, located within the code unit which makes
 *   use of the pluggable interface.  The consumer API should consist of:
 *
 *   . An interface-specific handle type which contains a vtable structure for
 *     the module (or a union of several such structures, if there are multiple
 *     supported major versions) and, optionally, resource data bound to the
 *     handle.
 *
 *   . An interface-specific loader function which creates a handle or list of
 *     handles.  A list of handles would be created if the interface is a
 *     one-to-many interface where the consumer wants to consult all available
 *     modules; a single handle would be created for an interface where the
 *     consumer wants to consult a specific module.  The loader function should
 *     use k5_plugin_load or k5_plugin_load_all to produce one or a list of
 *     vtable initializer functions, and should use those functions to fill in
 *     the vtable structure for the module (if necessary, trying each supported
 *     major version starting from the most recent).  The loader function can
 *     also bind resource data into the handle based on caller arguments, if
 *     appropriate.
 *
 *   . For each plugin method, a wrapper function which accepts a krb5_context,
 *     a plugin handle, and the method arguments.  Wrapper functions should
 *     invoke the method function contained in the handle's vtable.
 *
 * - Possibly, built-in implementations of the interface, also located within
 *   the code unit which makes use of the interface.  Built-in implementations
 *   must be registered with k5_plugin_register before the first call to
 *   k5_plugin_load or k5_plugin_load_all.
 *
 * A pluggable interface should have one or more currently supported major
 * versions, starting at 1.  Each major version should have a current minor
 * version, also starting at 1.  If new methods are added to a vtable, the
 * minor version should be incremented and the vtable stucture should document
 * where each minor vtable version ends.  If method signatures for a vtable are
 * changed, the major version should be incremented.
 *
 * Plugin module implementations (either built-in or dynamically loaded) should
 * define a function named <interfacename>_<modulename>_initvt, matching the
 * signature of krb5_plugin_initvt_fn as declared in include/krb5/plugin.h.
 * The initvt function should check the given maj_ver argument against its own
 * supported major versions, cast the vtable pointer to the appropriate
 * interface-specific vtable type, and fill in the vtable methods, stopping as
 * appropriate for the given min_ver.  Memory for the vtable structure is
 * allocated by the caller, not by the module.
 *
 * Dynamic plugin modules are registered with the framework through the
 * [plugins] section of the profile, as described in the admin documentation
 * and krb5.conf man page.
 */
    /* Holds krb5_context information about each pluggable interface. */
    /* A list of plugin interface IDs.  Make sure to increment
 * PLUGIN_NUM_INTERFACES when a new interface is added, and add an entry to the
 * interface_names table in lib/krb5/krb/plugin.c. */

    /*
 * XDR provides a conventional way for converting between C data
 * types and an external bit-string representation.  Library supplied
 * routines provide for the conversion on built-in C data types.  These
 * routines and utility routines defined here are used to help implement
 * a type encode/decode routine for each user-defined type.
 *
 * Each data type provides a single procedure which takes two arguments:
 *
 *	bool_t
 *	xdrproc(xdrs, argresp)
 *		XDR *xdrs;
 *		<type> *argresp;
 *
 * xdrs is an instance of a XDR handle, to which or from which the data
 * type is to be converted.  argresp is a pointer to the structure to be
 * converted.  The XDR handle contains an operation field which indicates
 * which of the operations (ENCODE, DECODE * or FREE) is to be performed.
 *
 * XDR_DECODE may allocate space if the pointer argresp is null.  This
 * data can be freed with the XDR_FREE operation.
 *
 * We write only one procedure per data type to make it easy
 * to keep the encode and decode procedures for a data type consistent.
 * In many cases the same code performs all operations on a user defined type,
 * because all the hard work is done in the component type routines.
 * decode as a series of calls on the nested data types.
 */
    /*
 * Xdr operations.  XDR_ENCODE causes the type to be encoded into the
 * stream.  XDR_DECODE causes the type to be extracted from the stream.
 * XDR_FREE can be used to release the space allocated by an XDR_DECODE
 * request.
