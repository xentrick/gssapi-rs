 *
 * If an item is too big to store on a single page, a flag is set and the item
 * is a { page, size } pair such that the page is the first page of an overflow
 * chain with size bytes of item.  Overflow pages are simply bytes without any

 * consecutive keys, a and b, will have all records greater than or equal to a

 * there are no duplicates of the cursor key in the tree (i.e. B_NODUPS is set
 * or there simply aren't any duplicates of the key) we copy the key that it
 * referenced when it's deleted, and reacquire a new cursor key if the cursor
 * is used again.  If there are duplicates keys, we move to the next/previous
 * key, and set a flag so that we know what happened.  NOTE: if duplicate (to
 * the cursor) keys are added to the tree during this process, it is undefined
 * if they will be returned or not in a cursor scan.
 *
 * The flags determine the possible states of the cursor:
 *
 * CURS_INIT	The cursor references *something*.
 * CURS_ACQUIRE	The cursor was deleted, and a key has been saved so that
 *		we can reacquire the right position in the tree.
 * CURS_AFTER, CURS_BEFORE
 *		The cursor was deleted, and now references a key/data pair
 *		that has not yet been returned, either before or after the
 *		deleted key/data pair.
 * XXX
 * This structure is broken out so that we can eventually offer multiple
 * cursors as part of the DB interface.
