 *
 * If @a is_last_req is true, then the KDC reply contained last-req entries
 * which unambiguously indicated the password expiration, account expiration,

 * be 0.)  Furthermore, a non-zero @a password_expiration should be taken as a

 * password_expiration will contain the expiration time of either the password
 * or account, or 0 if no expiration time was indicated in the KDC reply.  The

 * expiration warning.
 *
