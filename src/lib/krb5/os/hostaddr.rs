        /* Approach overview:

   If a system version is available but buggy, save handles to it (via
   inline functions in a support library), redefine the names to refer
   to library functions, and in those functions, call the system
   versions and fix up the returned data.  Use the native data
   structures and flag values.

   If no system version exists, use gethostby* and fake it.  Define
   the data structures and flag values locally.


   On macOS, getaddrinfo results aren't cached (though
   gethostbyname results are), so we need to build a cache here.  Now
   things are getting really messy.  Because the cache is in use, we
   use getservbyname, and throw away thread safety.  (Not that the
   cache is thread safe, but when we get locking support, that'll be
   dealt with.)  This code needs tearing down and rebuilding, soon.


   Note that recent Windows developers' code has an interesting hack:
   When you include the right header files, with the right set of
   macros indicating system versions, you'll get an inline function
   that looks for getaddrinfo (or whatever) in the system library, and
   calls it if it's there.  If it's not there, it fakes it with
   gethostby* calls.

   We're taking a simpler approach: A system provides these routines or
   it does not.

   Someday, we may want to take into account different versions (say,
   different revs of GNU libc) where some are broken in one way, and
   some work or are broken in another way.  Cross that bridge when we
   come to it.  */
        /* To do, maybe:

   + For AIX 4.3.3, using the RFC 2133 definition: Implement
   AI_NUMERICHOST.  It's not defined in the header file.

   For certain (old?) versions of GNU libc, AI_NUMERICHOST is
   defined but not implemented.

   + Use gethostbyname2, inet_aton and other IPv6 or thread-safe
   functions if available.  But, see
   https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=135182 for one
   gethostbyname2 problem on Linux.  And besides, if a platform is
   supporting IPv6 at all, they really should be doing getaddrinfo
   by now.

   + inet_ntop, inet_pton

   + Conditionally export/import the function definitions, so a
   library can have a single copy instead of multiple.

   + Upgrade host requirements to include working implementations of
   these functions, and throw all this away.  Pleeease?  :-)  */
