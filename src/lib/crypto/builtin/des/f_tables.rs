 * ((left & 0x55555555) << 1) | (right & 0x55555555)  for left half
 * (left & 0xaaaaaaaa) | ((right & 0xaaaaaaaa) >> 1)  for right half
 *
 * The scheme is that we index into the table using each byte.  The
 * result from the high order byte is or'd with the result from the

 * byte shifted left twice if or'd with the result from the low order
