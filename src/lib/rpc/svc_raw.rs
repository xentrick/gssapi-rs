/*
 * This interface must manage two items concerning remote procedure calling:
 *
 * 1) An arbitrary number of transport connections upon which rpc requests
 * are received.  The two most notable transports are TCP and UDP;  they are
 * created and registered by routines in svc_tcp.c and svc_udp.c, respectively;
 * they in turn call xprt_register and xprt_unregister.
 *
 * 2) An arbitrary number of locally registered services.  Services are
 * described by the following four data: program number, version number,
 * "service dispatch" function, a transport handle, and a boolean that
 * indicates whether or not the exported program should be registered with a
 * local binder service;  if true the program's number and version and the
 * port number from the transport handle are registered with the binder.
 * These data are registered with the rpc svc system via svc_register.
 *
 * A service's dispatch function is called whenever an rpc request comes in
 * on a transport.  The request's program and version numbers must match
 * those of the registered service.  The dispatch function is passed two
 * parameters, struct svc_req * and SVCXPRT *, defined below.

 * When the service routine is called, it must first check to see if

 * and return.  If so, it should deserialize its arguments via
 * SVC_GETARGS or the new SVC_GETARGS_REQ (both defined above).  If
 * the deserialization does not work, svcerr_decode should be called
 * followed by a return.  Successful decoding of the arguments should
 * be followed the execution of the procedure's code and a call to
 * svc_sendreply or the new svc_sendreply_req.
 *
 * Also, if the service refuses to execute the procedure due to too-
 * weak authentication parameters, svcerr_weakauth should be called.
 * Note: do not confuse access-control failure with weak authentication!
 *
 * NB: In pure implementations of rpc, the caller always waits for a reply
 * msg.  This message is sent when svc_sendreply is called.
 * Therefore pure service implementations should always call
 * svc_sendreply even if the function logically returns void;  use
 * xdr.h - xdr_void for the xdr routine.  HOWEVER, tcp based rpc allows
 * for the abuse of pure rpc via batched calling or pipelining.  In the
 * case of a batched call, svc_sendreply should NOT be called since
 * this would send a return message, which is what batching tries to avoid.
 * It is the service/protocol writer's responsibility to know which calls are
 * batched and which are not.  Warning: responding to batch calls may
 * deadlock the caller and server processes!
