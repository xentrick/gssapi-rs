    /*
 * XDR provides a conventional way for converting between C data
 * types and an external bit-string representation.  Library supplied
 * routines provide for the conversion on built-in C data types.  These
 * routines and utility routines defined here are used to help implement
 * a type encode/decode routine for each user-defined type.
 *
 * Each data type provides a single procedure which takes two arguments:
 *
 *	bool_t
 *	xdrproc(xdrs, argresp)
 *		XDR *xdrs;
 *		<type> *argresp;
 *
 * xdrs is an instance of a XDR handle, to which or from which the data
 * type is to be converted.  argresp is a pointer to the structure to be
 * converted.  The XDR handle contains an operation field which indicates
 * which of the operations (ENCODE, DECODE * or FREE) is to be performed.
 *
 * XDR_DECODE may allocate space if the pointer argresp is null.  This
 * data can be freed with the XDR_FREE operation.
 *
 * We write only one procedure per data type to make it easy
 * to keep the encode and decode procedures for a data type consistent.
 * In many cases the same code performs all operations on a user defined type,
 * because all the hard work is done in the component type routines.
 * decode as a series of calls on the nested data types.
 */
    /*
 * Xdr operations.  XDR_ENCODE causes the type to be encoded into the
 * stream.  XDR_DECODE causes the type to be extracted from the stream.
 * XDR_FREE can be used to release the space allocated by an XDR_DECODE
 * request.
